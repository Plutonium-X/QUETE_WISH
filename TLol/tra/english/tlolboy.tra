@0    = ~Did you make him leave ? Ha ! I won the bet !~
@1    = ~Wait, you knew that big guy ?~
@2    = ~Of course ! He arrived here a few days ago. Apparently he was some kind of northern bard and he even wanted to sing in the tavern, but they kicked him out. No problem, I'll get my two cents back from Lewik - he thought he'd have to throw rocks at him like Neeber to make him go away. Ha !~
@3    = ~A lonely bard's wish

The djinn I summoned gave me a letter that he thought might interest me. It appears that the note was written by a bard (although I don't know if I want to know about his other "works"). From what I've read so far, he was wandering around the south of the Trademeet gates. Let's hope it's not Volo...~
@4    = ~A lonely bard's wish

This is not what we expected.... The "bard" turned out to be an ugly half-orc, that came from the Far North. Unfortunately, I won't find out what he was looking for here - he ran away crying and I don't think he'll ever come back. Maybe we shouldn't have scared him when we arrived ? But who could have guessed that such a tough guy would turn out to be such a coward? Maybe I should be more careful about the wishes I want next time...~
